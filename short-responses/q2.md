# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in an `endpoint` as the first argument.

What is an endpoint in Express?

# Answer

An Endpoint in `Express` is a path. Similar to path's in React Router, these `paths` basically are where to find the data you are looking for.

# Teacher Feedback

Yup, when these paths are hit, the controller will determine what actions to take and send back a response.
